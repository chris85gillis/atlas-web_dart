# 0x00-hello_dart

This directory contains the first set of exercises in the Dart programming language track at Atlas School.

The exercises are designed to introduce you to the basics of Dart, including variables, data types, and functions. They are also designed to help you get comfortable with the Dart editor and the command line interface.

The exercises are as follows:

* 0-hello_holberton.dart: a simple "Hello World" program
* 1-quotes.dart: print a quote to the console
* 2-print_number.dart: print a number to the console
* 3-print_double.dart: print a double to the console
* 4-print_string.dart: print a string to the console
* 5-assertion.dart: assert a condition is true
* 6-positive_or_negative.dart: print whether a number is positive, negative, or zero

The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as each exercise builds on the concepts learned in the previous one. However, feel free to skip around if you'd like to focus on a particular concept.
